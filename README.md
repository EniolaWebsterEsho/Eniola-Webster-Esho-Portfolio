# [Project 1: Groundwater Level Prediction](https://github.com/EniolaWebsterEsho/Prediction-Codes)

Created a code that can predict groundwater level to help in water resource managment

Collected 19 years data including evaporation,

Used machining learning models decision tree regression, random forest regression

Also applied deep learning models like multilayer perception, artificial neural network, and bidirectional LSTM models

# [Project 2: Failed Banks Report with Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/dashboards/d8d7b785-de4a-4626-91c5-c8f7c460533d?ownerId=8647d4d1-04d0-4c1a-8a4f-bf49d3e82ad6&referrer=embed.appsource)

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive report on failed banks and their locations in this USA. This information is useful in providing guidance on cities where banks are likely to fail. The data 'fdic failed bank list' used was obtained online from data.gov.

From the data analysis and visualization report, the total number of failed banks as at 2023 is 563. Georgia, GA had the highest number of failed banks with a total of 93, followed by Florida and then Illinois with 76 and 69 respectively. Also, the year 2010 had the highest record of banks closing while the month of July was the highest. Furthermore, the city with highest number of bank closing is Chicago, Illinois.

In conclusion, new banks are more likely to succeed outside of these area.

# [Project 3: Diabetes Classification](https://github.com/EniolaWebsterEsho/Diabetes-Classification)
A.	Title:
Pima Indians Diabetes Database. This dataset is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and released by Johns Hopkins     University. 
B.	Data description:
There are number of 768 instances and 8 attributes with Class. All the attributes are numeric and the Class is categorical. The attributes are Number of times pregnant, Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test, Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), Triceps skin fold thickness (mm), 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml), Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2), Diabetes pedigree function, Age (years) and Class variable (0 or 1)

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

C.	Task:
Classify a person tests positive or negative for diabetes based on the 8 attributes.

# [Project 4: SQL & Entity Relationship Diagram Tasks](https://github.com/EniolaWebsterEsho/SQL-ERD-tasks)
Colonial tours database management system include information on customers, reservations, guides and trips. This database management system enables faster access to more accurate data and provides quick solutions to SQL queries. Also, this allows for effective data integration from multiple sources and provides consistent and reliable data.

By writing SQL queries, I extracted multiple desired information from the colonial tours dbms which helps in decision-making. Examples of information extracted include:

(a) The trip name of all reservations for hiking trips and sorted the results by trip name in
ascending order.

(b) The reservation ID, trip ID, customer number, and total price for all reservations where
the number of persons is greater than four.

(c) Trip IDs and trip names for each pair of trips that have the same start location. First trip ID listed was the major sort key, and the second trip ID was the minor sort key.

# [Project 5: Exploratory Data Analysis with Iris Dataset](https://github.com/EniolaWebsterEsho/Iris_Data_Analysis) 
The Iris Dataset contains four features which are length and width of both sepals and petals. There are 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). I carried out visualization of this data using scatter plot, a 3-dimentional plot, parallel coordinate plot, star plot, box plot, heat map and scatter plot matrix in R programming language.

# [Project 6: NBA Tweets Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/EniolaWebsterEsho/Big-Data-Analysis-Sentiment-Analysis)

Executed text and sentiment analysis on streamed NBA playoff tweets using NRC, BING and AFINN in R programming language and visualization using ggplot.

Accomplished visualization on the streamed twitter NBA tweets using Tableau dashboard tool to show date and time of tweets, location, followers count and other information.

# [Project 7: Population Distribution and Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/EniolaWebsterEsho/Population-Distribution-and-Hypothesis-Testing)

Analyzed datasets by performing statistical analysis like hypothesis testing and population distribution methods to get p-value and to determine null hypothesis rejection or not.

One of the datasets used is LungCapData in R Studio which include age, height, smoke, caesarean and lung capacity information. I used t-test to determine the following:

(a) whether or not the average lung capacity is greater than 8 with 98% confidence level

(b) whether the average age is less than 13 with a 95% confidence level
